# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This project aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using binary classification machine learning algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, Naive Bayes) and a dataset of patient information.
The project is divided into three separate Jupyter notebooks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Modeling
3. Conclusions
