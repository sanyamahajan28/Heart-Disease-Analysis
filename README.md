# Heart Disease Analysis

This project aims to model and predict the presence of heart disease in patients by using binary classification machine learning algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, Naive Bayes) and a dataset of patient information.

The project is divided into three separate Jupyter notebooks:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb)
2. [Modeling](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Modeling.ipynb)
3. [Conclusions](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/Conclusions.ipynb)
